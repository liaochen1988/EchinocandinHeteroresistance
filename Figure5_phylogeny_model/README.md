Run 'python3 run_phylogeny_model.py' to build and evaluate a phylogeny-based model.

This model placed genome sequences of the test isolates into a reference phylogenetic tree created by the training isolates and 
conducted hidden-state prediction to infer their micafungin heteroresistance labels.

The implementation of this model requires PICRUSt2 (https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/picrust/).
Please make sure that PICRUSt2 is installed and activated before running the script.
