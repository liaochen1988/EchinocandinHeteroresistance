This subfolder contains code to obtain numerical features of copy number variation (CNV) at the ORF (open reading frame) level.

The CNV of each ORF is characterized by two features: CNV cat (categorical variable) and CNV quant (quantitative variable).
CNV cat encompasses the following categories: normal, full amplification, partial amplification, full deletion, and partial deletion.
CNV quant describes the quantitative copy number of the region where amplification or deletion occurs.
If neither amplification nor deletion is detected, this feature has a value of 2.

In the example code (main.ipynb), our algorithm was performed over 5 *Candida parapsilosis* isolates as a demonstration."
