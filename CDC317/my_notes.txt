# The following notes describe the column names in the feature file
#------------------------------------------------------------------
The files in this directory contain information about chromosomal
features for Candida parapsilosis CDC317.

The notation "version_sXX-mYY-rZZ" in the filename indicates the genome version
to which data in the file corresponds. Detailed explanation about the genome
version notation can be found at: http://www.candidagenome.org/help/SequenceHelp.shtml#versions
Information pertaining to each version update for C. parapsilosis CDC 317 can be found at:
http://www.candidagenome.org/cgi-bin/genomeVersionHistory.pl?seq_source=C.%20parapsilosis%20CDC317

The file with "current" in its names is provided as a stable filename for
automated downloads. It is identical to (technically, symbolic links to) the
corresponding versioned file.

This file is updated weekly:

C_parapsilosis_CDC317_version_sXX-mYY-rZZ_chromosomal_feature.tab

Columns within chromosomal_features.tab:

1.  Feature name (mandatory); this is the primary systematic name, if available
2.  Gene name (locus name)
3.  Aliases (multiples separated by |)
4.  Feature type
5.  Chromosome
6.  Start Coordinate
7.  Stop Coordinate
8.  Strand
9.  Primary CGDID
10. Secondary CGDID (if any)
11. Description

16. Date of gene name reservation (if any).
17. Has the reserved gene name become the standard name? (Y/N)
18. Name of S. cerevisiae ortholog(s) (multiples separated by |)

Note: Genes that have been deleted from the current reference annotation
set are not included in this file.

# The following notes describe the column names in the gff file
#------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains the downloadable CGD files in the Generic
Feature Format (GFF).  These files describe features in CGD, including
chromosomes, ORFs, CDSs, introns, sequence gaps, intergenic regions, etc.
We also provide annotation of protein-coding genes in Gene Transfer Format (GTF).

Please see http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml for a detailed description
of the Generic Feature Format (GFF).

Please see http://mblab.wustl.edu/GTF22.html for a description
of the Gene Transfer Format (GTF).

The notation "version_sXX-mYY-rZZ" in the filenames indicates the genome version
to which data in the file corresponds. Detailed explanation about the genome
version notation can be found at: http://www.candidagenome.org/help/SequenceHelp.shtml#versions
Information pertaining to each version update for C. parapsilosis CDC 317 can be found at:
http://www.candidagenome.org/cgi-bin/genomeVersionHistory.pl?seq_source=C.%20parapsilosis%20CDC317

GFF files with "current" in their names are provided as stable filenames for
automated downloads. They are identical to (technically, symbolic links to) the
corresponding versioned files.

GFF files for previous genome versions are available in the archive sub-directory.

The following files are updated weekly:

C_parapsilosis_CDC317_version_sXX-mYY-rZZ_features.gff
    This file contains the current CGD annotation of the C. parapsilosis genome sequence.

C_parapsilosis_CDC317_version_sXX-mYY-rZZ_features.gtf
    This file contains the current CGD annotation of C. parapsilosis protein-coding genes in GTF.

C_parapsilosis_CDC317_version_sXX-mYY-rZZ_features_with_chromosome_sequences.gff.gz
    This file contains the current CGD annotation and the current genomic sequence
    of all chromosomes of the genome sequence. The annotations in this file and the
    previous file are the same. The chromosome sequences are specified
    in the "##FASTA" section at the end of this file according to GFF3 file format
    specifications (see http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml).

C_parapsilosis_CDC317_version_sXX-mYY-rZZ_intergenic.gff
    This file lists the intergenic regions between coding regions in the
    chromosomes. This file also contains lengths of these intergenic sequences
    and GC and AT content of each intergenic region (percent GC and percent AT).
